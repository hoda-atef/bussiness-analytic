Introduction to Data (Spread Sheet)

In this project, I leveraged statistical methods and spreadsheet tools (Excel) to analyze data from more than 500 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Specifically
I designed a Profit & Loss statement integrated with an S&P 500 company selector widget in Excel. 
Additionally, I created a dynamic income statement in Excel to forecast financial metrics under three potential scenarios for a selected company from the NYSE dataset.
